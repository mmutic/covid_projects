# Caltech Undergrad Covid-19 Projects #

**DISCLAIMER: This is unofficial work in progress by undergraduate students, and is not intended to inform any policies or decisions in any way.**

This repo holds work for four different Covid-19 project categories.

To contribute, go to the folder that represents your category and __create a branch for your project__ in order to keep commits for your subproject separate (e.g. those working in the Testing Strategies category could create branches for Pool Optimization, Sub-group Simulation, and On/Off Quarantines).

Merge your project branch into master roughly weekly so other groups can be aware of significant progress.
