# Testing Strategies #

This folder holds work for Testing Strategies projects.

To contribute, __create a branch for your project__ in order to keep commits for your subproject separate (e.g. those working in the Testing Strategies category could create branches for Pool Optimization, Sub-group Simulation, and On/Off Quarantines).

Merge your project branch into master roughly weekly so other groups can be aware of significant progress.
